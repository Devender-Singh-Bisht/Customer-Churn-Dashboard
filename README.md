# Customer Churn Dashboard

## Overview
The **Customer Churn Dashboard** offers a powerful, data-driven approach to understanding customer churn dynamics. Built to provide a comprehensive analysis of churn, this dashboard visualizes critical metrics, helping businesses better understand the reasons behind customer departures. This dashboard empowers companies to take action, reduce churn rates, and improve customer retention strategies by identifying key patterns and correlations.

## Key Features
- **Churn Distribution (Pie Chart)**: Highlights the percentage of customers who have churned versus those who have stayed with the company. This quick snapshot gives users an immediate understanding of overall churn behavior.
  
- **Customer Statistics (Table)**: Displays key statistics such as the **Average Monthly Charges**, **Average Total Charges**, and **Average Tenure** for both churned and retained customers. This helps businesses recognize the financial differences between the two customer segments.

- **Customers by Payment Method (Bar Chart)**: Breaks down churn by payment methods such as **Electronic Check**, **Mailed Check**, **Bank Transfer (Automatic)**, and **Credit Card (Automatic)**. This visual allows businesses to identify which payment methods may be correlated with higher churn rates, enabling focused customer retention strategies.

- **Customers by Type of Contract (Bar Chart)**: Shows how different contract types (Month-to-Month, One Year, Two Year) affect customer churn. It gives insights into the relationship between contract length and customer loyalty, allowing companies to adjust contract offerings to reduce churn.

- **Customers by Number of Tech Support Tickets (Bar Chart)**: Visualizes the churn rate based on the number of tech support tickets opened by customers. This chart reveals how customer experience with tech support impacts their likelihood of churning, providing opportunities for improvement in support services.

## Data Insights
- The churn rate is significantly higher among **month-to-month contract** customers, suggesting the need for businesses to incentivize longer-term contracts.
  
- **Electronic check** payment method users are more prone to churn compared to other payment methods, pointing to potential customer experience issues or dissatisfaction among these users.
  
- Customers with higher numbers of **tech support tickets** tend to churn more, indicating that improving customer support could play a major role in reducing churn.
